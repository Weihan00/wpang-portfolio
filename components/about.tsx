        After graduating with a master degree in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Computer Science</span>, I embarked on my
        professional journey. I worked as{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">IT consultant</span>, primarily
        responsible for digital transformation. I provide digital solutions for
        business groups, help organizations visualize, analyze, and optimize
        their business processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of technology, my role is more like that of a data analyst and
        web developer. I implemented{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">data ETL-process and data modeling</span>{" "}
        using SQL and visualized it through Tableau or PowerBI. Additionally, in
        response to user demands for interactive data, such as digitizing
        paperwork for various departments. I delved into{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">front-end web development</span>, and also
        constructed APIs by using JavaScript and SQL for data retrieval.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-3">
        Since then, my enthusiasm for web development has grown significantly.
        I've been dedicated to honing my skills. My core stack is{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">
          Javascript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB
        </span>
        . I am also familiar with TypeScript. Recently i am learning Next.js. I
        am currently looking for a{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">full-time position</span> as a front-end
        or full-stack developer.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-3">
        <span className="italic">When I'm not coding</span>, I enjoy reading
        books, watching movies, dancing and practicing yoga. I have always been
        curious and I greatly enjoy{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">learning new things</span>.
